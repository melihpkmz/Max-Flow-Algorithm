In this problem, you need to determine whether a given team has a chance to win the league or not.
- There are N different teams in the league, where 2≤N≤10 .
- There is always a winner in each match, no draws.
- Teams do not play their matches in a fixed order, teamA may have completed all its
matches whereas teamB still has to play 4 more matches to play.
- Each win grants 1 point to the winning team and losing team gets nothing.
- If multiple teams have the same and highest score at the end of the league, all those teams
win.
